        Almonds turn up everywhere in medieval cooking; in the first extant German cookbook, Das
        Buch von Guter Spise, dating to around 1350, almost a quarter of the
        recipes call for it. Almond milk was also a staple of the medieval kitchen.
        It was used in a wide variety of dishes as a substitute for milk or
        cream, especially on "fish days", when the church placed restrictions on
        what foods could be eaten (the most prominent of which were the days
        during lent). But it goes far beyond being used only as a spiritually
        necessary subsitute ingredient, turning up in all year round in blancmange, strawberry
        pudding, and other desserts.

    <div class="modern-recipe">
      <p>Ingredients:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Blanched almonds (1 cup)</li>
        <li>Water (2 1/2 cups)</li>
        <li>sugar (1/4 cup or to taste)</li>
        <li>Salt (1/4 tablespoon)</li>
        <li>
          Candied anise, borage, mint leaves, or other fresh green herbs (to
          garnish)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Instructions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Grind blanched almonds to a fine paste in a blender or food processor,
          adding about half a cup of water, a tablespoon at a time, during
          grinding. You might want to grind the almonds in two or three batches.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a saucepan, combine almond paste with the remaining two cups of
          water, sugar, and salt, stirring to blend smooth. Bring to a boil,
          reduce heat, and simmer, stirring frequently, for about ten minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour and scrape the mixture onto a large, clean white cloth, such as a
          dinner napkin or tea towel, laid on a large plate or cookie sheet.
          Spread the mixture out and let it cool. Then gather up the cloth by
          the corners, and gently wring it out over a cup or bowl. Tie the cloth
          up like a bag, and hang up the mixture in the cloth over a cup or bowl
          for at least three hours.
        </li>
        <li>
          Dish the almond cream into a lightly oiled mold or bowl. Refrigerate,
          and turn out onto a plate for serving. Garnish with candied anise, or
          fresh green herbs, such as borage or mint.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>Serves six to twelve</p>
