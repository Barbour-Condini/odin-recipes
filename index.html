      A medieval diet can be compatible with a range of different dietary
      requirements. Meat-free days are hard-coded into people's liturgical
      calendars; when it comes to cuisine, medieval communities are more
      flexible than they sometimes get credit for. This guide can help you find
      new ways to reduce or avoid the pesky animal products that can cause
      problems for you or your guests.
