      A medieval diet can be full of different dietary options. Meat-free days
      are hard-coded into people's liturgical calendars; when it comes to
      cuisine, medieval societies were more flexible than they sometimes get credit for.
      This guide will help you find medieval ways to minimise or completely avoid the
      pesky animal products that can cause problems for you or your guests.
