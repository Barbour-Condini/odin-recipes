      A medieval diet can be compatible with a range of different dietary
      requirements. Meat-free days are embedded into people's liturgical
      calendars; when it comes to cuisine, your medieval neighbours are more
      flexible than you might give them credit for. This guide can help you find
      new ways to reduce or avoid the pesky animal produce that can cause
      problems for you or your guests.
