      Fear not! This inter-networked pamphlet offers a guide to help you navigate
      medieval European dining as a vegetarian or vegan, or to host the Sir

      starter recipes to hand!

      A medieval diet can be full of vegan
      options and alternatives. This is a crowd who had meat-free days
      hard-coded into their liturgical calendars; when it comes to cuisine,
      they're a more flexible bunch than they sometimes get credit for. This
      guide will help you find ways to minimise or completely avoid the pesky animal products
      that can cause problems for you or your guests.
